# RESTfulAPI_AWS
This is a responsive web page that is running CRUD operations with a DynamoDB Database that is hosted on AWS. Other Amazon Web Services being used are Lambda (Node.js) and API-Gateway. I do not have my URL for the AJAX request, but I will add instruction on how to make your own that will work with this page.
